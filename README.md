## Description
Infinity Image Scroll is a lightweight web application that creates an endless gallery of random images. As users scroll down the page, new images are automatically loaded when they approach the bottom, creating a continuous browsing experience. The project features a clean, dark-themed design with a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

The application uses the Picsum Photos API to fetch random images and implements an efficient infinite scroll mechanism that triggers loading when the user is 100 pixels from the bottom of the page.
